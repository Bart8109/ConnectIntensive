One of the major skills you can bring to the table as a machine learnist is the ability to explore and understand a data set.

From [the pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html):\n",

If you're still feeling uncertain about a topic, often the best place to start is a quick web search.
